## Background

In today's mini-project we will analyze candy data with the exploratory graphics, basic statistics, correlation analysis and principal component analysis methods we have been learning thus far.

## Data Import

The data comes as a CSV file from 538

```{r}
head(read.csv("/Users/eloisesimpson/Documents/BIMM143/class09_candyproject/candy-data.csv"))
```


```{r}
candy_file <- "candy-data.csv"
candy = read.csv(candy_file, row.names = 1)
head(candy)
```

> Q1. How many different candy types are in this dataset?

There are 85 rows in this dataset

> Q2. How many fruity candy types are in this dataset?

```{r}
sum(candy$fruity)
```

```{r}
candy['Twix',]$winpercent
```

> Q3. What is your favorite candy (other than Twix) in the dataset and what is it’s winpercent value?

```{r}
candy['Air Heads',]$winpercent
```

> Q4. What is the winpercent value for “Kit Kat”?

```{r}
candy['Kit Kat',]$winpercent
```

> Q5. What is the winpercent value for “Tootsie Roll Snack Bars”?

```{r}
candy['Tootsie Roll Snack Bars',]$winpercent
```

```{r}
library("skimr")
skim(candy)
```

> Q6. Is there any variable/column that looks to be on a different scale to the majority of the other columns in the dataset?

The winpercent column

> Q7. What do you think a zero and one represent for the candy\$chocolate column?

A one means it is chocolate candy and a zero means it is not a chocolate candy

> Q8. Plot a histogram of winpercent values using both base R an ggplot2.

```{r}
library(ggplot2)
ggplot(candy, aes(x=winpercent)) +
  geom_histogram(bins=10)
```

> Q9. Is the distribution of winpercent values symmetrical?

No 

>Q10. Is the center of the distribution above or below 50%?

Below 

>Q11. On average is chocolate candy higher or lower ranked than fruit candy?

1.  Find all chocolate candy in dataset
2.  Extract or find their winpercent values
3.  calculate the mean of these values.
4.  find all fruit candy
5.  find their winpercent values
6.  calculate their mean value

```{r}
choc.candy <- candy[candy$chocolate == 1, ]
choc.win <- choc.candy$winpercent
mean(choc.win)
```

```{r}
fruity.candy <- candy[candy$fruity == 1,]
fruity.win <- fruity.candy$winpercent
mean(fruity.win)
```

Chocolate is higher

> Q12. Is this difference statistically significant?

```{r}
t.test(choc.win, fruity.win)
```

The p value is very small so yes it is.

# Overall Candy Rankings

> Q13. What are the five least liked candy types in this set?

```{r}
inds <- order(candy$winpercent)
head(candy[inds,],5)
```

Nik L Nip, Boston Baked Beans, Chiclets, Super Bubble, Jawbusters 

>Q14. What are the top 5 all time favorite candy types out of this set?

```{r}
tail(candy[inds,],5)
```

Reese's Peanut Butter cup, Reese's Miniatures, Twix, Kit Kat, Snickers.

> Q15. Make a first barplot of candy ranking based on winpercent values.

```{r}
ggplot(candy) +
  aes(winpercent, rownames(candy)) +
  geom_col() +
  ylab("") ##to remove label

ggsave("barplot1.png", height = 10, width = 6)
```

> Q16. This is quite ugly, use the reorder() function to get the bars sorted by winpercent?

```{r}
ggplot(candy) +
  aes(winpercent,
      reorder (rownames(candy), winpercent)) +
  geom_col() +
  ylab("") ##to remove label

ggsave("barplot2.png", height = 10, width = 6)
```

![My second barplot for Q16](barplot2.png)

I want custom colors that I pick so we need to make this ourselves

```{r}
my_cols <- rep("black", nrow(candy))
my_cols[candy$chocolate == 1] <- "pink"
my_cols[candy$bar] <- "yellow"
my_cols[candy$fruity == 1] <- "lightblue"
```

```{r}
ggplot(candy) +
  aes(winpercent,
      reorder (rownames(candy), winpercent)) +
  geom_col(fill=my_cols)
ggsave("barplot3.png", height = 10, width = 6)
```

> Q17. What is the worst ranked chocolate candy?

Nik L Nip 

>Q18. What is the best ranked fruity candy?

Reece's peanut butter cup

## Taking a look at pricepercent

Make a plot of winpercent vs the pricepercent

```{r}
library(ggrepel)
ggplot(candy) +
  aes(winpercent, pricepercent, label=rownames(candy)) +
  geom_point(col=my_cols) +
  geom_text_repel(col=my_cols, size=3.5, max.overlaps=5)
```

> Q19. Which candy type is the highest ranked in terms of winpercent for the least money - i.e. offers the most bang for your buck?

Reece's peanut butter cups 

>Q20. What are the top 5 most expensive candy types in the dataset and of these which is the least popular?

Nik l nip, chiclets, sugar babies

## Exploring the correlation structure

Pearson correlation values range from -1 to +1

```{r}
library(corrplot)
cij <- cor(candy)
corrplot(cij)
```

> Q22. Examining this plot what two variables are anti-correlated (i.e. have minus values)?

chocolate and winpercent 

>Q23. Similarly, what two variables are most positively correlated?

fruity and winpercent

## Principal Component Analysis

```{r}
pca <- prcomp(candy, scale = T)
summary(pca)
```

The main results figure: the PCA score plot:

```{r}
ggplot(pca$x) +
  aes(PC1, PC2, label=rownames(pca$x)) +
  geom_point(col=my_cols) +
  geom_text_repel(col=my_cols) +
  labs(title="PCA Candy Space Map",
       subtitle = "Colored by type",
       caption = "Data from 538")
```

The "loadings" plot for PC1

aes(winpercent, reorder (rownames(candy), winpercent))

```{r}
ggplot(pca$rotation) +
  aes(PC1, reorder (rownames(pca$rotation), PC1)) +
  geom_col()
```

> Q24. Complete the code to generate the loadings plot above. What original variables are picked up strongly by PC1 in the positive direction? Do these make sense to you? Where did you see this relationship highlighted previously?

Winpercent, pricepercent, bar, chocolate, fruity. In the correlation plot.

> Q25. Based on your exploratory analysis, correlation findings, and PCA results, what combination of characteristics appears to make a “winning” candy? How do these different analyses (visualization, correlation, PCA) support or complement each other in reaching this conclusion?

Having chocolate, being a bar, a good pricepercent. The visualisation helps to see whether the data supports a correlation between characteristics and popularity. The PCA displays which combinations are most powerful in driving people's preferences.

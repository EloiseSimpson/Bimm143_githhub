    At the comman line we type: 
    `git init`

    Add fiiles
    Modify files etc.
    
3. Add your important files to the "stage"
    In RStudio we click "stage" radio button
    `git add yourfilename`
    
4. Commit your staged files to the repository 
    In RStudio you just hit the "Commit" button and add a msg
    `git commit -m "your wee msg"`
